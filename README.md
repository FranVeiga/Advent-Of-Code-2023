# Advent Of Code - 2023 Edition

This repository contains my solutions to the 2023 Advent Of Code coding challenge.

To run the code for a particular day, go to its `src` directory and simply run:

```
$ cargo run --bin partX
```

Replace X with 1 or 2, depending on which part of the day's challenge you want to run.

Feedback on the solutions is greatly appreciated!
